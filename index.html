            <h3>Types</h3>
            <div class ="content">
                <p>1. Reactive AI are machines that perform operations based on a predefined set of rules that respond to the current situation without any reference to the past interactions. For example a chess bot is reactive. It takes the currect layout of the board and chooses the best option based on all the possibilities left.</p>
                <p>2. Limited Memory AI are systems that keep temporary storage to process past information to making decisions. Like autonomous vehicles that use recent sensor data to make real-time navigation decisions.</p>
                <p>3. Theory of Mind AI is a work in progress. The idea behind this is to develop systems that can understand humans emotions, beliefs and other things that are somewhat abstract.</p>
                <p>4. Self-Aware AI is the future of AI. The one most people think of when they here the term Artificial Intelligence. These systems will be self aware and can learn on their own.</p>

                <h3>Healthcare</h3>
                <div class ="content">
                    <p>The most common use of AI in the medical field is in “precision-medicine”. It's the application of AI in predicting the best regimen for a patient to follow in order to achieve desired health goals. The AI uses historical and patient data to make the most suitable decision for that specific patient.</p>
                    <p>AI is also being used to explain complex medical terms and research to prepare reports for stakeholders.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Business</h3>
                <div class ="content">
                    <p>According to Forbes, 51% of businesses are using AI in fraud management. AI in this use case is used to detect fraudulent activity based on past data and void the transaction before it succeeds.</p>
                    <p>Another use of AI in business is in customer service. These applications are typically performing the roles of call center employees or at least used to gather data about the customer before they reach an employee to better assist the employee in understanding the customer's needs.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Environment</h3>

                <div class ="content">
                    <p>AI has been used in tracking changes in the environment so humans can either better prepare or intervene when necessary. For example, AI can detect melting icebergs thousands of times faster than a human can.</p>

                    <p>AI also has been used in mapping or modeling the future that awaits. The way forest fires will affect forestation, climate change affect icebergs and the oceans from pollution all can be represented with the help of AI.</p>
                
                    <p>However, AI takes a lot of energy to perform computations, so there are some environmental concerns here that need to be researched. </p>

                <h3>Ethical Concerns</h3>

            <div class ="content">
                <p>AI can be considered as the interpretation of the data it uses to make decisions. Unfortunately, we live in a world where the data discriminates against groups like minorities and women. If the data used to train AI use discriminatory data, the AI will have discriminatory actions.
                </p>
            </div>
                <h3>Security Risks</h3>

            <div class ="content">
                <p>Again with AI making decisions based on its data, we have to be careful about data poisoning attacks. Organizations who use AI need to take extra security precautions in order to prevent hackers from accessing the data and injecting bias or any other harmful actions.
                </p>
                
            </div>
                <h3>Regulatory Issues</h3>

            <div class ="content">
                <p>With anything that can positively or negatively affect the lives of billions, there needs to be some level of regulation in order to minimize its application being used to abuse others. With AI there are many challenges when it comes to regulation. The main one being that AI is a field of study. There isn’t a single solution to regulating something that is as complex as AI. With these complexities comes more challenges in understanding the technology you are trying to regulate. Even experts have different opinions on how these AIs work, which will make it difficult for legislators to get a firm understanding. </p>

            <div class ="content">
               <p>Waymo, a former Google project, is a company that provides fully electric self driving services in America’s biggest cities. This service allows people to get to and from without interacting with any humans. With their fleet of cars being fully electric they have a smaller carbon footprint than competitors like Uber/Lift and with their “drivers” being AI, every ride collects data that will be used to expand their services across the world.</p>
            </div>
                <h3>Cautionary Tales</h3>

            <div class ="content">
                <p>Most people know you can't believe everything you see, hear or read. This is especially true with AI. AI is still a developing field and some of the predictions, answers or text generated can be incorrect or non existent at all. In fact, a New York lawyer was fine $5,000 for citing fake court cases during a trial that he got from ChatGPT. The lawyer failed to ensure that the information he received from the AI was real and just blindly believed it. Now he will forever be attached to this one short sighted action. </p>

            <div class ="content">
                <p>In conclusion, AI is a remarkable field of study with many applications that can greatly benefit the world. There are some concerns with security, ethics, reliability and regulation. However, with the right preperations and design decions, the damages can be limited and the benefits limitless.</p>
